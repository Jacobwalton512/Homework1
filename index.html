            Hello my name is Jacob Walton. I am currently a new home sales consultant with Pacesetter homes.I am learning to code at 
            the coding bootcamp at the University of Texas at Austin. I am happy to say that this one of the most exciting challenges
            I've undertaken in my life, and I've had quite a few of those. I played cards professionally for nearly two years flying to Vegas
            a total of 37 times, I started a roofing company at 24 that grossed over 9 million dollars in revenue annually, and I began
            my life in Austin homeless at the age of 17. For me coding has become something to relax with every day. I can't wait to be able to turn
            something I love into a career. I am a huge star wars fan and have seen every movie on the day of it's release since Episode 1.
            I live in Roundrock with my best friend of 10 years and my white german shepard Lacie.
